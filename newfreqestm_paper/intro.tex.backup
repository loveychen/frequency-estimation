\section{INTRODUCTION}
Frequency is an important parameter in power systems. Accurate frequency estimation is imperative from protection point of view. But the estimation becomes harder in presence of noise and higher frequency components. Amongst the existing methods of computation the Zerocrossing method fails in presence of higher harmonics. Various methods have been developed up till now for estimation of frequencies and all have their distinct advantages. The modified zero-crossing technique \cite{modzcd}; level crossing technique \cite{levelcross}; least-square technique \cite{leastsquare}; Kalman filter technique \cite{kalman1},\cite{kalman2}; and phasor based techniques \cite{leakeffect,phasor1,lovell,synchro,phadkebook}.These methods are fixed-frequency methods suitable for steady-state frequency. Methods utilizing feedback loops such \cite{phasecontrol}, Phase Locked Loop(PLL); phasor-based synchronized measurement\cite{synchro} are methods which estimate dynamic frequency. 
In these different frequency measurement techniques the phasor-based technique is found to be more accurate which measures the frequency with better accuracy at steady state. These methods follow a common way of estimating the positive-sequence phasor at off-nominal frequency, eventhough the DFT is taken at nominal frequency. The phase angle change in the phasor is a function of deviation of frequency from nominal frequency. For a frequency modulated signal $x(t)=Acos(\phi(t))$, where $A$ represents the magnitude and $\phi$ represents the cumulative phase angles, instantaneous frequency is calculated as $f(t) = (1/2\pi)(d\phi /dt)$.
In the following paper we proposed a novel method for estimation of frequency which takes the advantage of phasor-based technique to estimate amplitude of the orignal and averaged signal and hence the deviation in frequency. This methods has advantage in terms of accuracy, speed and robustness over other methods mentioned in the paper. We first present a theoretical analysis of the proposed method and then later support it with simulation results for a clean 3-phase signal and then real signal from generator and a power system. Finally prove its efficacy for a three-phase power system. The results are compared with three other standard methods vis PLL method, Phadke-Thorp \cite{phadkethorp} method and the traditional zero-crossing method.
