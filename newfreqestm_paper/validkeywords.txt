1998 IEEE Approved Indexing Keyword List
========================================

In November of 1995 the IEEE Technical Activities Board (TAB)
passed the following resolution regarding the inclusion of an
abstract and indexing keywords with all manuscripts submitted
by prospective IEEE authors:


    "In order to provide accurate, timely and cost-effective
     information about all IEEE periodical publications and
     conference proceedings, ...
         1. It shall be TAB policy that all papers published
         in IEEE Transactions, Journals, Letters, conference
         proceedings and where appropriate, Magazines, shall
         include an abstract and appropriate indexing terms
         (keywords) selected from a centrally maintained IEEE
         "thesaurus,"
    and,
         2. To implement this policy, IEEE staff is instructed
         to develop procedures that enable authors, editors or
         conference committees to provide that information, or
         as an alternative, to provide for its generation as an
         optional IEEE service."


In order to help prospective authors comply with the above policy
the IEEE Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) Products Department makes
available the current list of approved Indexing Keywords used to
characterize all archival IEEE articles published. This keyword list
(or 'thesaurus') is made available as an autoretrievable ASCII file
by sending an e-mail to keywords@ieee.org . The response to the
e-mail sends the alphabetical list of approved IEEE keyword terms.

This latest revision, new as of 1998, superceeds and replaces all
previous versions; using outdated keyword lists will make articles
harder for researchers to locate. We suggest you DO NOT SAVE THIS
FILE AFTER COMPLETING YOUR ARTICLE. Instead, always autoretrieve
the latest revision directly from IEEE each time you need to add
keywords to newly composed articles.

Articles that include indexing keywords help identify and emphasize
important subject matter they report. In addition:
- Electronic searches for articles are often more productive when
    authors provide keywords (or 'indexing terms') in addition to
    the abstract to locate articles.
- Concepts inherent (but unstated) in an article should normally be
    indexed unless they are so rudimentary as to be presumed by any
    novice looking for information. An author should use judgment,
    but it is always better to err on the side of inclusion rather
    than exclusion.
- IEEE policy -- and good indexing practice -- assigns the most
    specific indexing keywords available to describe the major
    points or topics covered in the article.
- Choosing keywords from the current IEEE Indexing list promotes
    standardized indexes


              HOW TO CHOOSE THE BEST INDEXING KEYWORDS
            ============================================
LIST:
- Make a list of the major topics embodied in your article.
    Be as specific as possible in describing the concepts or ideas
    in the article.

SELECT:
- Search through the list of approved IEEE keywords. Select the
    closest matching word or phrase for each topic in the article.
- It is hard to predict how many keywords will suffice. Experience
    has shown us that most IEEE articles are well indexed if they
    use five to eight indexing keywords.
- As new technologies evolve, when there are no appropriate IEEE
    keywords the author is encouraged to create keywords. These
    will be monitored and may be incorporated in future keyword lists.
