\section{CONCLUSIONS}
This paper has proposed a new method of computing system frequency that consides dynamic performance of the reported frequency. The following results were obtained:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the proposed method is found to be accurate with error\% within 0.01\% for frequencies in the range of 47-53 Hz and its accuracy fairly depends upon the accuracy of the lookup table of sinc used.
\item The time for estimating frequency is independent of the value of frequency. Once the required accuracy is set, the data window size i.e. value of $k$ can be fixed.
\item by varying the data window size from one cycle ($k=1$) till four cycles ($k=4$) the algorithm gave better results but at the expense of a delay of $2k$ cycles.
\item for estimating the rate-of-change of frequency the algorithm showed encouraging results for clean signals and noisy signals when $k=3$ or $k=4$ cycles.
