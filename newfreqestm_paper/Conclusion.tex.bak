\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In this paper, we have addressed two problems in optimal BPS computation.
\begin{itemize}
\item Computation of minimum BPS.
\item Computation of maximum independent minimal BPS.
\end{itemize}
The problem
of computing maximum independent minimal BPS is posed for the first time in this paper. Further,
we have proposed a generic ILP formulation for optimal BPS computation. Some of the salient features
of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ILP formulation provides an efficient approach to computation of optimal BPS. This is because
more often than not, the relaxed LP formulation directly leads to an integral vertex.
\item ILP approach can model the phantom buses and relays with ease.
\item Conceptually, it is more worthwhile to look for maximum independent minimal BPS rather than MBPS. Fortunately, it is found that often one of the multiple MBPS also corresponds to a maximum independent
minimal BPS.
\item The paper provides an insightful and detailed investigation of the BPS problem from a graph theoretic perspective.
\end{itemize}
Further, a decomposition approach was developed for large scale systems. This led to a  good approximation to the optimal BPS problem. Comparison with other methods
in literature demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
