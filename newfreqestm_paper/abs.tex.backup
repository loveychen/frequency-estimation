Phasor-based estimation techniques are used for measuring instantaneous power system frequency. These methods are characterised by a very good steady state response and dynamic characteristics. The following paper proposes a novel phasor-based technique for frequency and rate of change of frequency estimation by estimating the amplitudes of both the voltage signal and its moving averaged signal. The proposed method is characterised by fixed speed, good accuracy and robustness. A well documented experimental results at the end prove the efficacy of this method.
