We propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the minimum relay Break Point Set (BPS) computation. Subsequently, in the ILP framework, we propose an alternate
maximum independent relay BPS formulation with the intention of minimizing dependency within the BPS. We show that 1)
in practice, the relaxed version of the ILP suffices to obtain integral vertex and 2) the relaxed version of 
the ILP can be efficiently solved by the Dual-Simplex method.  The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared
and contrasted with existing algorithms. Case studies on various test systems show the efficacy of the
proposed approach.
